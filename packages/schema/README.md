# @math-block/schema

This package generates and exports two schemas which represent the AST
generated by @math-blocks/editor-parser.  The `parsingSchema` and `semanticSchema`
have almost the same structure.  The only difference is that all child nodes in
`parsingSchema` are nominally `Node`s which is a union of all possible node types.
`semanticSchema` on the other hand differentiates between `NumericNode`s,
`LogicNode`s, and `SetNode`s.  `semanticSchema` prevents invalid ASTs such as

```javascript
const invalidTree = {
    type: "add",
    args: [
        {
            type: "eq",
            args: [],
        },
        {
            type: "eq",
            args: [],
        },
    ],
};
```

Upon initial parsing @math-blocks/editor-parser will produce an AST conforming
to `parsingSchema` which is then validated against `semanticSchema`.
